      <p>Hey there!!</p>
      <p>This is the first time I've built something with zonelets and it's sorta exciting. It's so nifty.</p>
      <p>I'm just so glad we live in a world filled with creative folks that can do this stuff. Maybe one day I can be as smart and ingenius as the people that make the world I wish to live in.</p>
      <p>I'm getting there though! It's been exactly 1 year since my coding journey!!! and uh. It's been... a ride.</p>
      <p>In case it wasn't known, I originally was in a different field, working full time!</p>
      <p>When I was diagnosed with the autism, it sorta connected that I was going through autistic burnout.</p>
      <p>I'd go through jobs, "high functioning" until 6 months to a year in I'd suddenly get extreme burnout.</p>
      <p>So I was like... what could I possibly do? I have no great talent. I'm not successful in really anything that brings me joy. I'm, in all sense, bog standard.</p>
      <p>Thankfully I saved up enough to take a year to just... learn. Learn how to be, how to love myself, and how to do what's best for myself.</p>
      <p>That's when I picked up coding!! I really wanted to do something with web dev or front-end engineering. I still don't have a job... but it'll get there. I hope.</p>
      <p>My code is still spaghetti. I still have to look up random things. My JS is... laughable.</p>
      <p>But with practice, I'll get there!</p>
      <p>However, with the job market and how it is, I'm realising how impossible it is to get a job without any basis of AI.</p>
      <p>Just so you know, I have some pretty strong opinions on AI. At this point, I refuse to use it.</p>
      <p>... but that also means that I've gotten rejected from jobs because of this refusal.</p>
      <p>well. Such is life. I'll keep chugging on, learnig, and loving.</p>
      <p>Peace and love from my first blog post!</p>
      <p>Cheers!</p>
